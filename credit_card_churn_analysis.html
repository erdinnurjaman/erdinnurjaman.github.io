									<h1>Credit Card<br />
									Churn Analysis</h1>
									<p>This project is a personal project to practice my critical thinking and communicate reports in one page visualization</p>
								</header>
								<p class="judul">Background Information</p>
								<p>A manager at the bank was annoyed with
									more and more customers are leaving the card service
									their credit. They would really appreciate if someone
									can know the customer profile so they can
									know which customers will go so they
									can proactively go to customers to
									provide better service and change decisions
									customer in the opposite direction.</p>
								
								<p class="judul">Objective</p>
								<p>Recommend data-driven strategies to understand customer habits and reduce the percentage of customers that churn in a single page report or dashboard.</p>
								
								<p class="judul">Analysis Method</p>
								<p>Analyze more deeply on variables that impact customer churn rates such as credit limits, credit card categories and the number of contact customers who make late payments in a year.</p>
								
								<p class="judul">Structured Sections</p>
								<p>I split the report into three sections, focussing on credit limit, card category, and contact count.
									In each section, I created a header to highlight the recommended action that could be taken to improve operations. 
									Below this, I then used the technique of providing an introductory summary for each visual, then used the visual to reinforce the message, to create a balance between text and visual mediums.</p>
								
								<p class="judul">Recommendation</p>
								<p>&rarr;  Give an increase in the credit limit to customers who reach a minimum credit usage.<br/>
									 &rarr;  Give attractive rewards or benefits for each level of the customer card category.<br/>
									 &rarr;  Reduce the frequency of contacting customers and create better alert strategies for customers who are late making payments.<br/></p>
